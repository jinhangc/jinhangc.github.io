I am a fifth-year PhD student in the department of [Operations Research and Financial Engineering](https://orfe.princeton.edu) at Princeton University, under the supervision of Professor [Jianqing Fan](https://fan.princeton.edu). Previously, I received bachelor's degree from School of Mathematical Sciences at Peking University, with double major in Economics.

I am generally interested in
- High-dimensional estimation and inference
- Statistical decision-making (Dynamic Pricing, RL)
- Generative models, LLM

I enjoy badminton, tennis, hiking, etc. Feel free to reach out if you want to chat research or other topics!
